## CODE VALIDATION

### HTML

The [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML file.

| File | Screenschot | Status|
|:---|:---: | :---: |
| `index.html`| ![Index](documentation/validations/html.png) | Pass |

The void elements can optionally have a trailing slash and some people prefer to include it as it may look clearer. Some HTML formatters integrated in code editors automatically add a trailing slash to void elements.

## CSS

The [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the project, the results are shown below. 

| Screenschot | Status|
|:---: | :---: |
| ![W3C CSS Validator](/documentation/validations/v-css.png) | Pass | 

[CSS Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fworth-a-trip-drf-40e2fa952827.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

| App/File | admin.py | apps.py | models.py | serializers.py | tests.py | urls.py | views.py | 
|:---|:---: | :---: |:---: | :---: |:---: | :---: |:---: |

| profiles | pass | n/a | pass | pass | n/a | pass | pass |
| wishes |  n/a | n/a | pass | pass | n/a | pass | pass |

Note: add a new line at end of the posts/admin.py file to pass

| App/File | asgy.py | permissions.py | serializers.py | settings.py |  urls.py | views.py | wsgi.py |
|:---|:---: | :---: |:---: | :---: |:---: | :---: |:---: | 
| drf_api | pass | pass | pass | pass | pass | pass | pass |

## AUTOMATED TESTING

The Django's Built-in Unit Testing Framework was used to test the application functionality on the project without errors.
To perform the test the following step was used:
- In the terminal type the command:

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```

The Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not.

Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by tests, and which are not.

To install:
```bash
python3 -m pip install coverage
```
Use `coverage run`  to run your test suite and gather data. However you normally run your test suite, you can use your test runner under coverage.

Use `coverage report`  to report on the results and for a nicer presentation, use coverage html to get annotated HTML listings detailing missed lines.

This tool will be used in the future again.

### TEST CASE

#### Backend

A test case were written in the backend to proof the post feature to ensure:
- we can view all objects
- logged in user can create a new Post object and view object
- logged in user cannot access a invalid id
- owner can update his own post
- logged in user cannot update another users post

A creation of a temporary database was needed.

*Note:* new fields were implemented after writing the test, such as country and ratings. 

#### Frontend

The `NavBar` and `NotFound` components were tested via jest unit test in the React app.

The following command is used to run the tests:
```
npm test
```

![Test Components](documentation/testing/test-components.png)

*Note:* the `NavBar.test.js` needs to be rewritten due to the implementation of the sign out modal, which was implemented after this test.
