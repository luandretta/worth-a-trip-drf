## Data Models

- Profile

- Posts

The model will give the users the ability to store posts in the database and the serializer will convert and validate the model instances. It'll also add fields that are not stored in the database.

- Wishes

## API Endpoints

## Frameworks, libraries and dependencies

- Django Rest Framework

- Signals

Signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place. Theyâ€™re especially useful when many pieces of code may be interested in the same events.

- Serializers

Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types

- Coverage

Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not. Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by tests, and which are not.

- React Bootstrap - ![React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/)

The most popular front-end framework, as one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as the UI foundation. Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. The result is a set of accessible-by-default components.

- React Router 
To control what the user sees depending on the URL they have accessed in the browser.

- Axios
To tell the React project to send requests to the API 

- Dayjs
To format dates in React
